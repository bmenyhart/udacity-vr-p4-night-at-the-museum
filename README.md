# Night at the Museum Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

Project is made by Borbala Menyhart.

## Versions
- Unity 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

The project is about How Virtual Reality could revolutionize the Residential Real Estate Industry, and be used in the Homebuying journey.

There are four scenes in the project.
First is the Welcome scene. From here, you can navigate to the second main scene, the Museum scene. In the Museum scene, there are five stations. 
I recommended to start at the Introduction station and then reverse clockwise visit the other stations. 
From the third and the fourth station, you can navigate to additional demo scenes. From these scenes, you can navigate back to the Museum.
Use the waypoints to move in the scenes and the Back to the Museum sign to navigate back to the Museum.
